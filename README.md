# ToDo-List
This is a basic `To-Do List` application build with `AngularJS`.

## Clone ToDo-List:
To get you started you can simply clone the ToDo-List repository. There is no dependencies to install.
AngularJS is distributed as a JavaScript file, we added it to our web page with a `script tag` to keep this example simple.
```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
```
### Clone the angular-seed repository using git:
```git
git clone https://github.com/diina-gh/ToDo-List/
cd ToDo-List
```
If you don't have `git`, you can get it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
